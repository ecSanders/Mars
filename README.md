# Overview

This repository is to show off some of the skills I learned from the Image Processing tutorial from MATLAB. This includes:

- Segmentation
- Registration
- Filtering
- Edge Detection
- Batch Processing

# Development Environment

For this project I used the MATLAB IDE and the computer vision apps that are associated with it.

# Useful Websites

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/)

# Future Work

A couple of items that could be improved upon for this project are:

- The quality of the segmentations
- Finishing a count of the rocks in each image
- Running batch processing to determine whether it has a rover or not.
